# AlaeCal Products Finder #
I created this product for playing and familiar with PHP, and deeply know AlgaeCal's most popular three products. I got inspired by AlgaeCal's bone loos quiz on the main website(https://quiz.algaecal.com/sf/quiz/bone-health/?target=warm), and through this activity, I gain knowledge from zero to basic PHP.
